- Segmentation fault on defining function based on previous version of itself

- Make ncurses and graphical user interface

- Improve way in which functions and variables are saved to file
	- Currently if multiple calculators are open simultaneously, they won't
	both be able to save stuff

- Support for complex numbers

- Support for vectors and matrices

- Support for arrow keys and other basic text editing

- Support for command line options
	- Specify a save file
	- Send a calculation straight to program to output to stdout

- When defining a function that divides by zero, the function should still be
  saved. Currently it simply isn't.
